Scraping is extracting information from webpage, filtering out and cleaning the data, then storing the data.

This could be triggered automatically when something changes in the webpage

Scraping data:
URL constant
import requests
import selectorlib

.get(url)
.text

if __name__

optional headers=HEADERS constant


Extracting data:
inspect element in browser and get ID

selectorlib.Extractor.from.yaml_file(extract.yaml)
create extract.yaml with tours and css with id displaytimer
.extract(source)["tours"]


if extracted data != no upcoming tours then check if extracted data != text file (in append mode), if not, store data in text file and send email.
